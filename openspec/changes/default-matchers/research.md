# Research

The prototype behind [the design][design], measured on boxes.

## 1. Generated and regex-engine matchers

A prototype branch, `research/default-matchers`, swaps each hand matcher of Protocol Buffers, Zig and Lua for a default.
[The research note][default-matchers-note] links it at a pinned commit and gives the method.

Callgrind counts the lexing pass over each language's oracle fixtures at one codegen unit (`bench/AGENTS.md` rule 12), in millions of instructions:

| Language | Hand | Regex engine | Ratio | Generated | Ratio |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| Protocol Buffers | 4.5 | 11.5 | 2.5644 | 5.8 | 1.2958 |
| Zig | 25.0 | 86.5 | 3.4591 | 29.4 | 1.1746 |
| Lua | 27.5 | 124.7 | 4.5401 | 42.2 | 1.5374 |

- The generated rows are from the prototype before Protocol Buffers' `OptionStmt` was generated.
  Task 1.2 brings the row with it.
- Allocations do not change on either path.
- 243 of the 245 patterns are generated.
  Protocol Buffers' `String` has a back-reference.
  Zig's `NumbersAt6` repeats a group whose arms both start with `e`.
  Both run on the regex engine.

The differential test of [design section 2.3][design] found no difference:

| Language | Fixture lines | Fuzzed lines | Positions | Matches compared | Differences |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| Protocol Buffers | 3,374 | 2,000 | 207,300 | 8,084,700 | 0 |
| Zig | 43,320 | 2,000 | 1,447,153 | 79,593,415 | 0 |
| Lua | 40,717 | 2,000 | 1,680,199 | 255,390,248 | 0 |

## 2. The steps

Task 1.2 changes the generated code one step at a time.
Each step is backed by a profile per function and followed by the differential test.
Lexing ratios against the hand matchers, at one codegen unit:

| Step | Protocol Buffers | Zig | Lua |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|
| generated, before the steps | 1.2568 | 1.1746 | 1.5374 |
| 1. a node that holds only ASCII tests one byte | 1.2418 | 1.0748 | 1.4057 |
| 2. steps spent at each byte read | 1.2556 | 1.2468 | 1.6277 |
| 2b. steps spent in loops, replacing 2 | 1.2604 | 1.1062 | 1.4450 |
| hand matchers out of line, on 2 | 1.2565 | 1.2500 | 1.6189 |
| hand matchers out of line, on 2b | 1.2604 | 1.1094 | 1.4362 |

- The first row for Protocol Buffers has `OptionStmt` generated.
- Step 2 kept the `\b` test out of line.
  Step 2b brings it back in line and spends once per loop.
- Moving the hand matchers out of line saves little.
  On 2b, Lua runs 0.6% fewer instructions, Zig 0.3% more and Protocol Buffers the same.
  The generated code covers nearly every pattern, so the hand path is cold.

The profile names the costs left, and each becomes a step:

- a pattern tests its first byte before its code runs;
- a matcher records only the groups a scope or a back-reference reads, where it writes every group today;
- the `\b` test decodes the character before the position, which costs Zig 2.1 and Lua 3.0 million instructions;
- the language's `matcher` calls one dispatch function, which calls the pattern's function.
  A flat dispatch goes straight to the pattern's function: the second level costs Lua about 4.8 million instructions.

## 3. Coverage

Five Lua end patterns have neither generated code nor a regex engine path: the ends of long strings and long comments.
Each reads a group of its begin pattern through a back-reference, such as `]\1]`.
They keep their hand code, a coverage gap that task 1.3 closes.
